# Gmail Frontend Clone

A simple Gmail frontend clone built with **ReactJS**.  
I was bored one day and decided to hack this together as a way to polish my frontend skills.

## Features
- Gmail-like layout and UI
- Built with React components
- Styled with modern frontend practices (MUI / TailwindCSS if used)
- Purely frontend — no backend or actual email integration

## Why
Not trying to reinvent Gmail. Just a fun project to practice building a clean, responsive, and familiar UI.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/gmail-clone.git```
   
2. Install dependencies:
  ```npm install```

3. Run the dev server:
   ```npm start```

### Notes
- This is not a functional email client. It’s just the frontend.
- Built for learning and experimentation.
